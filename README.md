# Reddit Comment Sentiment Analysis using Deep Learning

## Description
This project aims to build a deep learning model that detects emotions in social media posts (tweets, captions, etc.). By analyzing the text, the model classifies it into predefined emotion categories such as **happy**, **sad**, **angry**, etc. The model leverages **TF-IDF** for text vectorization and a **neural network** built with **TensorFlow** and **Keras** for classification.

## Tech Stack
- **Python** (for coding)
- **pandas** (for data manipulation)
- **numpy** (for numerical computing)
- **matplotlib** & **seaborn** (for data visualization)
- **nltk** (for text processing)
- **scikit-learn** (for machine learning)
- **TensorFlow** & **Keras** (for deep learning)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/Emotion-Detection-ML.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project folder:
    ```bash
    cd Emotion-Detection-ML
    ```

3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Run the notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook
    ```

## Project Structure
- **`emotion_detection.ipynb`**: The main code where the data is loaded, cleaned, and used to train the model.
- **`requirements.txt`**: A file listing all the necessary libraries to run the project.
- **`dataset.csv`**: The dataset used for training and testing the model.
- **`README.md`**: This file!

## Accuracy & Results
- The model achieved an accuracy of **85%** on the test data.
- Below is the **confusion matrix** for the model's predictions:

## Future Scope
- Extend the model to handle multi-language text.
- Use transformer models like **BERT** to improve accuracy.
- Apply this model in real-time applications like sentiment analysis for customer feedback.
